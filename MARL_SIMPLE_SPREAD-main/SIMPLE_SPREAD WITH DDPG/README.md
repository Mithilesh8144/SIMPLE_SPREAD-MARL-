# MARLDDPG
2 Experiments using DDPG have been conducted and their results have been documented.

-EXPERIMENT 1 using 3 SEPARATE PAIRS of actor-critic networks have been used to improve the reward function.

-EXPERIMENT 2 using 1 pair of actor-critic network, parameter sharing is involved and the networks are shared between all 3 agents.

Since DDPG involves continuous action space I recommend checking the source code and modifying the action space accordingly for more details refer to :
